## üì§ Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Create an account on Vercel if you don't have one
2. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
3. Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to deploy your application

### Other Deployment Options

#### Netlify

1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your project:
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "npm run build"
     publish = ".next"
   ```
2. Push your code to GitHub
3. Import your repository on Netlify
4. Configure the build settings and deploy

#### GitHub Pages

For GitHub Pages, you'll need to export your Next.js app as static HTML:

1. Update your `next.config.js` to include:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     output: 'export',
   }
   ```
2. Build and export your app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. The static files will be in the `out` directory, which you can deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain:

1. Purchase a domain from a domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.)
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
3. Set up the custom domain in your hosting provider's dashboard
4. Add SSL certificate for HTTPS (most providers offer this for free)
